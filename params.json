I will add credit to the original developers when i track their articles down.\r\n\r\nI do not want to take anyones work as my own, but over the many copies and saves and compressions the original developers headers were removed.\r\n\r\nIf you find any of the original works online, please tell me so that I can give the due credit.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
