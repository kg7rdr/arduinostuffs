Adventures in the wonderful world of MCU
========================================

This is where I am saving and sharing random bits and stuff from arduino-related projects.

Note:
Some of the code has been found and used from long since forgotten sources. I will add credit to the original developers as I track their articles down.

I do not want to take anyones work as my own, but over the many copies and saves and compressions the original developers headers were removed.

If you find any of the original works online, please tell me so that I can give the due credit.
