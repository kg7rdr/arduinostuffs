        <p>Hello...</p>

<p>Simply put. I think that if you are using Github, you know what all of this stuff is anyways so I wont bother to explain. This could also be linked to my hobby of lazyness and busy</p>

<p>Oh, and here is my horrible readme. Who reads these things anyways?</p>

<p>This is where I am saving and sharing random bits and stuff from arduino-related projects.</p>

<p>Note:
Some of the code has been found and used from long since forgotten sources. I will add credit to the original developers when i track their articles down.</p>

<p>I do not want to take anyones work as my own, but over the many copies and saves and compressions the original developers headers were removed.</p>

<p>If you find any of the original works online, please tell me so that I can give the due credit.</p>
